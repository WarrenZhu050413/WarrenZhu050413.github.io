A pocket notebook has been the most meaningful change in my daily routine
since the launch of ChatGPT. It's also the thing that is the easiest for
anyone else to do (you just need a pocket, a notebook that would fit inside
that pocket, and something to write with).

When I'm waiting for a bus, Uber, some person, my muscle to recover its
strength in the gym, or my poop to be displaced in the correct placr, I can
now do some doodling.

In the middle of some talk or a group conversation, I can pull out my
notebook and no one will be mad (unlike my phone)—I even look (lol) vaguely
cool.
