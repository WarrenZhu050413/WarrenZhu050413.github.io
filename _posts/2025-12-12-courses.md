## Courses Taken at Harvard

### Bad Courses

I have had the pleasure of attending courses (to complete graduation requirements) that I very much disliked. Weirdly, they helped me understand myself more than the good courses, [via negativa](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12199316-via-negativa-the-principle-that-we-know-what-is-wrong). Here is a thank you list:

- Expos20: Is it Okay To Be A Luddite (Compulsory Writing Course)
- CS1060: Software Engineering with GenAI (I love Christopher but I don't think Software Engineering should be teached. There were also so, so many tiny quizzes and attendance and homework it was dystopian.)

### Unintuitively Great Courses

- SLAVIC148: Strange Russian Writers (Has the best reading list ever and makes me want to goto all Soviet Bloc countries)
- GENED1136: Power and Politics, China (Wow. Kirby and Bol are really, really knowledgeable. They helped me appreciate the greatness of true historians. It is also a refreshingly rigorous GENED.)
- STAT288: Deep Statistics. (Xiao-Li is GOATED).
- COMPSCI143: Computer Networking. (Networking is beautiful, and HT Kung is legendary.)
