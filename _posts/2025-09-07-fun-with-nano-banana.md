I believe in two things in AI models:

1. The demos always oversell the capabilities of the models.
2. The demos always undersell the possibilities with them.

Because of this, playing around with a new release is both Extremely Disappointing and Wonderfully Exciting.

So here are my favorites with NanoBanana:

## 1. It really hopes that my head is longer than it is :(

<span class="commentary">Yes, nano-banana, I know that my head is too much of a circle. But you don't have to make it so clear...</span>

<span class="commentary">To give a bonus... Here I ask it to put me with the long-headed version of me side by side. Nano-Banana ignored the original me completely and put the long-headed version with itself. Why?!!</span>

## 2. Nano-Banana can be very literal

<span class="commentary">I asked it to change the face, and it ONLY changed the face.</span>

## 3. It doesn't listen to instructions at all

## 4. Playing around it is really, really fun...

## 5. I just cannot get it to do what I want it to do. Always ends up with bananas everywhere. But it is still fun...

## 6. Have a Good Day!
