    <h1>Warren 朱富橙</h1>
    <p>I'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I want to build tools that help us learn, think, and be happy.
    <br><br>
    I love and hate modern technology, and I am especially skeptical of (social) science. I split my time between playing with new technology, reading about old ideas, and being (technology free) with loved ones.

## Education

- **Harvard University** (Class of 2026)
  - B.A. in Computer Science
  - M.S. in Statistics
  - Secondary in Educational Studies

## Current Projects

- I'm working on [Studio Tenwu](https://studiotenwu.github.io) with [Matthew Kotzbauer](https://www.facebook.com/matthew.kotzbauer.50/). We want to reimagine K-12 education with Agentic AI, but to be completely frank, we do not know what we are doing and we are trying to learn as much as possible about K-12 and EdTech. We have ran a small experiment in [PokeCraft](https://github.com/StudioTenwu/PokeCraft).

## ML Systems Projects

- I've worked on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. I presented "CRAFT: A Pytorch-based Protocol for Composing Fault Tolerance Techniques" ([poster](/assets/posters/CRAFT_poster.png)) as a poster in Pytorch Conference 2025, and I have contributed to [torchFT](https://github.com/pytorch/torchft/) to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.

## Statistics Research

I did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02134" target="_blank">It</a> appeared in <a href="https://www.cclear.cc" target="_blank">clear2025</a>.

## Teaching

I had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:

Fall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow.
Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.

I have also been tutoring highschoolers after seeing how helpful I could be to my sister in thinking through her academic and life choices. It has been even more fun than teaching college students!

### Other Hobbies

I went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby. However, my experience with some of the bureaucracies there, as well as just being a child who was not suitable with the general educational system, left me deep scars and made me want to improve the educational experience of people for the better.

I had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the <a href="https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/essay-prizes/philosophy/Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize in 2021" target="_blank">Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize</a> for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the [John Locke Essay Prize](https://www.johnlockeinstitute.com/essay-competition) for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.

I am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.

### Bad Courses

I have had the pleasure of attending courses (to complete graduation requirements) that I very much disliked. Weirdly, they helped me understand myself more than the good courses, [via negativa](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12199316-via-negativa-the-principle-that-we-know-what-is-wrong). Here is a thank you list:

- Expos20: Is it Okay To Be A Luddite (Compulsory Writing Course)
- CS1060: Software Engineering with GenAI (I love Christopher but I don't think Software Engineering should be teached. There were also so, so many tiny quizzes and attendance and homework it was dystopian.)

### Unintuitively Great Courses

- SLAVIC148: Strange Russian Writers (Has the best reading list ever and makes me want to goto all Soviet Bloc countries)
- GENED1136: Power and Politics, China (Wow. Kirby and Bol are really, really knowledgeable. They helped me appreciate the greatness of true historians. It is also a refreshingly rigorous GENED.)
- STAT288: Deep Statistics. (Xiao-Li is GOATED).
- COMPSCI143: Computer Networking. (Networking is beautiful, and HT Kung is legendary.)
