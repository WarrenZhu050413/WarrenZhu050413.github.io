## Education

- **Harvard University** (Class of 2026)
  - B.A. in Computer Science
  - M.S. in Statistics

## Projects
- I'm interested in improving the fault tolerance of distributed ML to make it more scalable and cost-efficient. I'm a contributor to [torchFT](https://github.com/pytorch/torchft/).
- I'm developing a framework on top of PyTorch called [torchLoom](https://github.com/WarrenZhu050413/torchLoom) that gives much more observability and control over ML training process.

### Research
I did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02134" target="_blank">It</a> is upcoming in <a href="https://www.cclear.cc" target="_blank">clear2025</a>.

### Teaching
Fall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, working with the wonderful Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow.
Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein.

### Other Hobbies
I went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I did not care too much about STEM and had very fond memories in History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Rugby.

I had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the <a href="https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/essay-prizes/philosophy/Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize in 2021" target="_blank">Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize</a> for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the [John Locke Essay Prize](https://www.johnlockeinstitute.com/essay-competition) for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.

I am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks as well as Brideshead Revisited.
