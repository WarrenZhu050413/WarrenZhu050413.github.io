    <h1>Warren 朱富橙</h1>
    <p>I'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I want to build tools that help us think through deep and complex problems. I believe this requires building a) adaptive informational interfaces for humans, b) self-organizing tools to manage our knowledge and preferences, c) cognitive environments that feel natural to use.
    <br><br>
    I love and hate the modern world, and I am especially skeptical of (social) science. I split my time between playing with new technology, reading about old ideas, and being (technology free) with loved ones.

## Education

- **Harvard University** (Class of 2026)
  - B.A. in Computer Science
  - B.A. in Statistics
  - M.S. in Statistics

## Current Projects

- I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)
- My most recent thoughts are in this [post](https://www.warrenzhu.com/hci/2025/09/22/homo-faber-or-what-i-want-to-do.html)

## ML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)

- I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. "CRAFT: A Pytorch-based Protocol for Composing Fault Tolerance Techniques" is accepted to Pytorch Conference 2025, and I have contributed to [torchFT](https://github.com/pytorch/torchft/) to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems. I have left much undone, and I would love to share my thoughts if anyone is interested in taking them on.
- I have sketched out how to generalize the PyTorch grid-like DeviceMesh abstraction into a Tree for hierarchical SGD scenarios. I have not implemented it in PyTorch since the engineering work to get it compatible with everything is substantial, but would love to share my thoughts there also.

## Statistics Research

I did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02134" target="_blank">It</a> appeared in <a href="https://www.cclear.cc" target="_blank">clear2025</a>.

## Teaching

I had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:

Fall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow.
Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.

I have also been tutoring highschoolers after seeing how helpful I could be to my sister in thinking through her academic and life choices. It has been even more fun than teaching college students!

### Other Hobbies

I went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.

I had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the <a href="https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/essay-prizes/philosophy/Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize in 2021" target="_blank">Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize</a> for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the [John Locke Essay Prize](https://www.johnlockeinstitute.com/essay-competition) for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.

I am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.
