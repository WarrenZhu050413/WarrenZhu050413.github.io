### Other Hobbies
I went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I did not care too much about STEM and had very fond memories in History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Rugby.

I had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the <a href="https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/essay-prizes/philosophy/Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize in 2021" target="_blank">Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize</a> for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the [John Locke Essay Prize](https://www.johnlockeinstitute.com/essay-competition) for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.

I am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks as well as Brideshead Revisited.
