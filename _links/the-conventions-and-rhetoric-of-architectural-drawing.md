Chapter 12 from "Origins, Imitation, Conventions: Representation in the Visual Arts" (MIT Press, 2002). Ackerman explores how architectural conventions—plans, elevations, perspectives—are arbitrary inventions that work only when they mean the same thing to observer and maker. He traces the evolution of drawing instruments from quill pens to graphite, and how the rectangular format of paper itself shapes architectural representation.
