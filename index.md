I'm a senior at Harvard University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's degree in Statistics.

My first intellectual love is philosophy, but have since explored art history, math, statistics, and computer systems, and now, human-computer interaction.

Right now, I am spending my time understanding what are the best human interfaces for new technologies, and writing about Writing.
