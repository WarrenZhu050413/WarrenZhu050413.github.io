  <div class="about-intro">
    <p>I'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I want to build tools that help us learn, think, and be happy.</p>
    <p>I love and hate modern technology, and I am especially skeptical of (social) science. I split my time between playing with new technology, reading about old ideas, and being (technology free) with loved ones.</p>
