    <h1>Warren 朱富橙</h1>
    <p>I'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I want to build tools that help us understand things, communicate to others, and be happy.</p>
    <p>I love and hate modern technology, and I am especially skeptical of (social) science. I split my time between playing with new stuff, reading about old things, and being with loved ones.</p>

## Currently

- I'm exploring new AI interfaces with [Matthew Kotzbauer](https://matt.quest).

## Education

- **Harvard University** (Class of 2026)
  - B.A. in Computer Science
  - M.S. in Statistics
  - Secondary in Educational Studies

## Research

### ML Systems Projects

- I've worked on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. I presented "CRAFT: A Pytorch-based Protocol for Composing Fault Tolerance Techniques" ([poster](/assets/posters/CRAFT_poster.png)) as a poster in Pytorch Conference 2025, and I have contributed to [torchFT](https://github.com/pytorch/torchft/) to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.

### Statistics Research

I did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02134" target="_blank">It</a> appeared in <a href="https://www.cclear.cc" target="_blank">clear2025</a>.

Also with Connor, I contributed to <a href="https://github.com/cjerzak/fastrerandomize-software" target="_blank">fastrerandomize</a>, a GPU-accelerated R package for statistical rerandomization in experimental research. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07642" target="_blank">paper</a> is forthcoming in SoftwareX.

## Teaching

I had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:

Fall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow.
Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.

I have also been tutoring highschoolers after seeing how helpful I could be to my sister in thinking through her academic and life choices. It has been even more fun than teaching college students!

For Winter 2025, I went to Yerevan, Armenia to lead a two week Learning Lab on "Building Tools with GenAI" at TUMO. I had the sweetest experience that I wrote about [here](/posts/yerevan-bye/).

## Other Miscenalleous Facts

I went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby. However, my experience with the bureaucracies there, as well as just being a child who was not suitable with the general educational system, made me often terribly unhappy, and helped me understand I will have a difficult time being in a system with a great amount of formality.

I had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the [Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/essay-prizes/philosophy/) for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the [John Locke Essay Prize](https://www.johnlockeinstitute.com/essay-competition) for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.

I like to absorb vocabulary from different languages by setting my electronic's system language to them. I've graduated from the Spanish phase and I'm currently in the French/Italian/German phase. I've also found that it is a good way to hide response latency from Language Models. This is the prompt that I use:

```
### Language Mode
LANGUAGES=[Italian, French, German]
Begin every response with:

1. **Full translations**: One line per language, formatted as [Flag Emoji] [Full sentence translation]

2. **Phrase alignment table** (for prompts ≥8 words): A markdown table aligning non-cognate and structurally divergent phrases:

| English  | 🇮🇹 Italian        | 🇫🇷 French         | 🇩🇪 German         |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [phrase] | **[translation]** | **[translation]** | **[translation]** |

Skip rows where all three are obvious cognates (e.g., university/università/université/Universität). Include brief parenthetical notes for grammatical divergences (case marking, word order, pronoun dropping, fused forms). Keep tables ≤10 rows, prioritizing: verb constructions, question formation, preposition differences, and words with distinct etymological roots across the three.
```
