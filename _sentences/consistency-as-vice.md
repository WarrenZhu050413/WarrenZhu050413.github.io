Consistency is a vice except in Mathematics. In any other field (even Statistics) we can get too bogged down on consistency (of estimators, in this case). Life would be less fun if we stopped speaking in fear of contradicting ourselves. In fact, the world may be silent except for a few obstinate, fanatical, and (occasionally) utterly brilliant voices.
