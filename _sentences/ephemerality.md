I've always found it difficult to store and organize things—knowledges, possessions, rules. I've come to believe that an artificial effort at preservation evil. I believe that Religion works so well because we inevitably violate the mandated rules, and that Privacy is important to help people break (too-restrictive) rules. I find spaced reptition abhorrent, detailed note-taking uninspiring. I can't understand people who are sad when they forget (unimportant) things. When I finally something on my calendar, I celebrate. I try, as best as I can, let life wash over me with experience, perhaps because by nature I want to hold onto too many things—or maybe because all men come to understand that self-consciousness only disturbs good cosmic vibrations.

I think about Borges and "Funes, His Memory", Nietzsche and the Library of Alexandria, Nassim Taleb and Via Negativa.
